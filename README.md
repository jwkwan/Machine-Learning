# Machine-Learning
This respository contains some samples of codes for different models.  The codes might not be optimal but rather for learning and training purpose.
I have added the first linear regression function in python to the repository



I have started playing with python and my first one is the linear regression function.

-> EDAProject.ipynb : To determine whether a subscriber will become a premier subsciber.
  -> appdata10.csv : initial applicatio data for all subscribes. Due to the size, it is not in this direcotry
  -> new_appdata10.csv : pre-processed data written by the program

-> Churn.jpynb     : To determined which subscribers are likely to be churned
  -> churn_data.csv : inital application data for all subscribers.
  -> new_churn_data.csv : pre-processed data written by this program
